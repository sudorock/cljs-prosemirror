These functions work\n  by making a pristine copy of your entity, and tracking what fields have been touched.  You are responsible\n  for triggering these various states by marking fields as complete (`mark-complete!`), telling it to\n  copy the data to/from pristine (e.g. `entity->pristine`), and by asking for out-of-date data for the current\n  vs. pristine copy (`dirty-fields`).\n\n  There is also support for detecting which fields have been marked complete and are dirty.\n\n  Validation can be done via Clojure spec, or by defining your own field validation functions via\n  `make-validator`. This general-purpose validation factor function can easily be used to create more\n  automated validation factories that can be more configuration-driven, but this is left as an exercise for the community.\n\n  See the Developer's Guide for more information.\n  \"\n  (:require\n    [clojure.spec.alpha :as s]\n    [clojure.set :as set]\n    [taoensso.timbre :as log]\n    [edn-query-language.core :as eql]\n    [com.fulcrologic.guardrails.core :refer [>def >defn >defn- =>]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.algorithms.tempid :as tempid]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations :refer [defmutation]]\n    [com.fulcrologic.fulcro.components :as comp :refer [defsc]]))\n\n(def ident-generator #(s/gen #{[:table 1] [:other/by-id 9]}))\n\n(>def ::id (s/with-gen eql/ident? ident-generator))         ; form config uses the entity's ident as an ID\n(>def ::fields (s/every keyword? :kind set?))               ; a set of kws that are fields to track\n(>def ::subforms (s/map-of keyword? any?))                  ; a map of subform field to component class\n(>def ::pristine-state (s/map-of keyword? any?))            ; the saved state of the form\n(>def ::complete?
