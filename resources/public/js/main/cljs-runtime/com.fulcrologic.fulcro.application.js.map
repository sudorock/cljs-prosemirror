Normally Fulcro will populate app state with\n     your component tree's initial state.  Use `mount!` options to toggle the initial state pull from root.\n   * `:optimized-render!` - A function that can analyze the state of the application and optimally refresh the screen.\n     Defaults to `ident-optimized-render/render!`, but can also be set to `keyframe-render/render!`.  Further customizations are\n     also possible.  Most applications will likely be best with the default (which analyzes changes by ident and targets\n     refreshes), but applications with a lot of on-screen components may find the keyframe renderer to be faster. Both\n     get added benefits from Fulcro's default `shouldComponentUpdate`, which will prevent rendering when there are no real\n     changes.\n   * `default-result-action!` - A `(fn [env])` that will be used in your mutations defined with `defmutation` as the\n     default `:result-action` when none is supplied. Normally defaults to a function that supports mutation joins, targeting,\n     and ok/error actions. WARNING: Overriding this is for advanced users and can break important functionality. The\n     default is value for this option is `com.fulcrologic.fulcro.mutations/default-result-action!`, which could be used\n     as an element of your own custom implementation.\n   * `:global-eql-transform` - A `(fn [AST] new-AST)` that will be asked to rewrite the AST of all transactions just\n     before they are placed on the network layer.\n   * `:client-did-mount` - A `(fn [app])` that is called when the application mounts the first time.\n   * `:remotes` - A map from remote name to a remote handler, which is defined as a map that contains at least\n     a `:transmit!` key whose value is a `(fn [send-node])`. See `networking.http-remote`.\n   * `:shared` - A (static) map of data that should be visible in all components through `comp/shared`.\n   * `:shared-fn` - A function on root props that can select/augment shared whenever a forced root render\n     or explicit call to `app/update-shared!` happens.\n   * `:props-middleware` - A function that can add data to the 4th (optional) argument of\n     `defsc`.  Useful for allowing users to quickly destructure extra data created by\n     component extensions. See the fulcro-garden-css project on github for an example usage.\n   * `:render-middleware` - A `(fn [this real-render])`. If supplied it will be called for every Fulcro component\n     render, and *must* call (and return the result of) `real-render`.  This can be used to wrap the real render\n     function in order to do things like measure performance, set dynamic vars, or augment the UI in arbitrary ways.\n     `this` is the component being rendered.\n   * `:remote-error?` - A `(fn [result] boolean)`. It can examine the network result and should only return\n     true when the result is an error. The `result` will contain both a `:body` and `:status-code` when using\n     the normal remotes.  The default version of this returns true if the status code isn't 200.\n   * `:global-error-action` - A `(fn [env] ...)` that is run on any remote error (as defined by `remote-error?`).\n   * `:load-mutation` - A symbol. Defines which mutation to use as an implementation of low-level load operations. See\n     Developer's Guide\n   * `:query-transform-default` - A `(fn [query] query')`. Defaults to a function that strips `:ui/...` keywords and\n     form state config joins from load queries.\n   * `:load-marker-default` - A default value to use for load markers. Defaults to false.\n   * `:render-root!` - The function to call in order to render the root of your application. Defaults\n     to `js/ReactDOM.render`.\n   * `:hydrate-root!` - The function to call in order to hydrate the root of your application. Defaults\n     to `js/ReactDOM.hydrate`.\n   * `:root-class` - The component class that will be the root.
