During\n  operation it also adds (by default) fetch markers into the app state so you can show busy indicators on the UI\n  components that are waiting for data. The `:target` parameter can be used to place the data somewhere besides app\n  state root (which is the default).\n\n  The server will receive a query of the form: [({server-property (comp/get-query class-or-factory)} params)], which\n  a Fulcro parser will correctly parse as a join on server-property with the given subquery and params. See the AST and\n  instructions on parsing queries in the developer's guide.\n\n  Parameters:\n  - `app-or-comp` : A component instance or Fulcro application\n  - `server-property-or-ident` : A keyword or ident that represents the root of the query to send to the server. If this is an ident\n  you are loading a specific entity from the database into a local app db table. A custom target will be ignored.\n  - `class-or-factory` : A component that implements IQuery, or a factory for it (if using dynamic queries). This will be combined with `server-property` into a join for the server query. Needed to normalize results.\n    class-or-factory can be nil, in which case the resulting server query will not be a join.\n  - `config` : A map of load configuration parameters.\n\n  Config (all optional):\n  - `target` - An assoc-in path at which to put the result of the Subquery (as an edge (normalized) or value (not normalized)).\n    Can also be special targets (multiple-targets, append-to,\n    prepend-to, or replace-at). If you are loading by keyword (into root), then this relocates the result (ident or value) after load.\n    When loading an entity (by ident), then this option will place additional idents at the target path(s) that point to that entity.\n  - `initialize` - REMOVED. Use component pre-merge instead.\n  - `remote` - Optional. Keyword name of the remote that this load should come from.\n  - `params` - Optional parameters to add to the generated query\n  - `marker` - ID of marker. Normalizes a load marker into app state so you can see progress.\n  - `refresh` - A list of things in the UI to refresh. Depends on rendering optimization.\n  - `focus` - Focus the query along a path. See eql/focus-subquery.\n  - `without` - A set of keys to remove (recursively) from the query.\n  - `update-query` - A general-purpose function that can transform the component query before sending to remote. See also\n     the application's `:global-eql-transform` option.\n     For example, to focus a subquery using update-query: `{:update-query #(eql/focus-subquery % [:my {:sub [:query]}])}`\n     Removing properties (like previous :without option): `{:update-query #(df/elide-query-nodes % #{:my :elisions})}`\n  - `abort-id` - Set a unique key. If supplied, then the load can be cancelled via that abort ID.\n  - `parallel` - Send the load out-of-order (immediately) without waiting for other loads in progress.\n  - `post-mutation` - A mutation (symbol) to run *after* the data is merged. Note, if target is supplied be sure your post mutation\n    should expect the data at the targeted location. The `env` of that mutation will be the env of the load (if available), but will also include `:load-request`.\n  - `post-mutation-params` - An optional map that will be passed to the post-mutation when it is called.\n  - `post-action` - A lambda that will a mutation env parameter `(fn [env] ...)`. Called after success, like post-mutation\n    (and after post-mutation if also defined). `env` will include the original `:load-params` and raw network layer `:result`. If you\n    want the post behavior to act as a top-level mutation, then prefer `post-mutation`. The action can also call `transact!`.\n  - `fallback` - A mutation (symbol) to run if there is a server/network error. The `env` of the fallback will be like a mutation `env`, and will\n    include a `:result` key with the real result from the server, along with the original `:load-params`.\n\n  Special-purpose config options:\n\n  The config options can also include the following things that completely override behaviors of other (respons-processing) options,\n  and should only be used in very advanced situations where you know what you are doing:\n\n  - `ok-action` - WARNING: OVERRIDES ALL DEFAULT OK BEHAVIOR (except load marker removal)! A lambda that will receive an env parameter `(fn [env] ...)` that\n    includes the `:result` and original `:load-params`.\n  - `error-action` - WARNING: OVERRIDES ALL DEFAULT ERROR BEHAVIOR (except load marker update).
